The [run.py]() file itÂ´s a manual test, in which we have a graph: search.romania (see [search.py]())
that represents a variety of cities in romania and the distances between them.
The manual test creates a GPSProblem (ab) this shows the problem we need to solve:
Finding a path from city A to city B through the different cities in romania. For every algorithm
implemented we display the time it has taken to process, the nodes generated and visited, and the 
cost it took to get from city A to city B.


The package tests has 5 different examples and what should each algorithm display after figuring the path
(nodes generated, visited, total cost and the path).
To try this tests: [main_tests.py]()
